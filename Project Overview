Project Overview: MATLAB-ImageToSkeleton

Introduction

MATLAB-ImageToSkeleton is a project designed to extract the skeleton mask of objects in an image using MATLAB. It utilizes various image processing techniques, including grayscale conversion, thresholding, and morphological operations, to produce a thin, connected skeleton of objects. This is useful in applications such as object recognition, medical imaging, and shape analysis.

Objectives

- To develop a MATLAB-based method for generating skeleton masks from images.
- To enhance object recognition using skeletonization techniques.
- To apply thresholding and morphological operations for noise reduction and refinement.
- To analyze the efficiency of skeletonization for various image types.

Methodology

1. Image Acquisition: Load an input image.
2. Preprocessing: Convert to grayscale (if necessary) and adjust contrast.
3. Thresholding: Convert the image to binary format.
4. Noise Removal: Use morphological operations to eliminate small objects.
5. Skeletonization: Apply thinning techniques to extract the skeleton mask.
6. Post-processing: Remove unwanted branches or refine the skeleton.
7. Visualization: Display and analyze the final skeleton mask.

Implementation

- The project is implemented using MATLAB.
- Uses the Image Processing Toolbox for thresholding and morphological operations.
- Provides an efficient skeletonization method suitable for real-world applications.

Applications

- Medical Imaging: Blood vessel and bone structure analysis.
- Forensics: Fingerprint and handwriting recognition.
- Robotics & AI: Pathfinding and object recognition.
- Agriculture: Plant structure and root analysis.
- Traffic & Surveillance: Road network extraction and object tracking.

Results & Observations

- The generated skeleton mask effectively represents the core structure of objects.
- Proper preprocessing enhances the accuracy of the skeletonization process.
- Morphological operations help in noise removal and skeleton refinement.
- The method is computationally efficient but may require fine-tuning for complex images.

Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the process of skeletonization using MATLAB. The extracted skeleton masks are useful in multiple fields requiring shape analysis. Future improvements could focus on real-time processing and handling more complex object structures.
