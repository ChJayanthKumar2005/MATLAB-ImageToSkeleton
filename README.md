# MATLAB-ImageToSkeleton
"MATLAB-ImageToSkeleton" – A MATLAB-based project for extracting skeleton masks from images using preprocessing, thresholding, and morphological operations. Useful for shape analysis, object recognition, and feature extraction in computer vision applications.

📌 Project Description
MATLAB-ImageToSkeleton is a MATLAB-based project for extracting skeleton masks from images. It utilizes preprocessing, thresholding, and morphological operations to generate a thin, connected skeletal structure of objects in images. This technique is widely used in image processing for shape analysis, object recognition, and feature extraction.

🔥 Features
- Converts images to skeletonized representations
- Uses adaptive thresholding for better object extraction
- Applies morphological operations to refine the skeleton mask
- Works with grayscale and binary images
- Useful for computer vision and pattern recognition applications

🚀 Installation & Setup
1. Ensure you have MATLAB installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MATLAB-SkelMask.git
   
3. Navigate to the project folder and open MATLAB.

📌 Usage
1. Load an image in MATLAB:
   matlab
   img = imread('input_image.jpg');
   
2. Run the skeletonization script:
   matlab
   skeleton_mask(img);
   
3. The output will display the skeletonized version of the object.
